BookBot is my first project!

Welcome to your first project! We're going to build "Book Bot" - a Python program that can analyze an entire book and print out an interesting statistical report. A few of the learning goals are:

Configure a professional Python development environment on your local computer
Deploy a Python project on your personal GitHub account
Learn how to use a professional code editor (VS Code)
Put your Python and Git skills to the test in a real project
